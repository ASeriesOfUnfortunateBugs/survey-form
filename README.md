# A basic survey form
I have been working through freeCodeCamp.org's responsive web design curriculum to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and give myself a refresher on design techniques. I thought it would be fun to share my designs here. 

This is my solution for the survey form project. Design-wise, I wanted to focus on making a clean design using basic CSS and HTML principles without grabbing assets from outside sources. Additionally, I wanted the design to be as accessible as possible across devices.
